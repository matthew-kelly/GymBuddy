# SwoleMates

SwoleMates is a fully-featured social platform for safely finding likeminded people you want to work out with, and avoiding the ones you donâ€™t. Through its anonymous, categorized, and deeply sortable event calendar, users can find workout partners with similar interests while maintaining their privacy in our safe online social community. Created by @matthew-kelly and @comberj.
